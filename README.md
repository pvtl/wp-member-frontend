# A WordPress Plugin for displaying member only forms and pages

## Setup

- Install and activate the plugin
- Create a page and assign the Members Template under Page Template.

## Templating

Don't like the layout of the forms? You're able to override the templates in your own theme, by adding your own views within your theme directory.

_* We recommend copying the source template so that you have the correct fields and helper methods ready for the forms._
